### Initial Readme on first realease

  PKU was in development for about a year before I could
not continue working on the project. Rather than let it
die, I released the source as is.

  Naturally this leaves it in a fairly incomplete state,
albeit functional.

  There's a lot of legacy code left over from when I was
learning to use Unity, so some scripts (namely the PC 
and Bag interfaces) are functional though implemented
rather poorly.

  I'm hoping that the PokÈmon Game Development Community
will be able to continue my work and eventually get this
project into a fully functional state.

---------------------------------------------------------

  If you need to contact me regarding the project for 
any reason, you can reach me via my [Pokemon-Unity Subreddit](https://www.youtube.com/user/EclipseJewel), or
the [Pokemon-Unity Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnity/) although I can't guarantee
when I'll see it or how much I can help.
  I will try though.

  Thank you to everyone who supported me during the 
development of PokÈmon Unity. 
  I hope this source is useful.
