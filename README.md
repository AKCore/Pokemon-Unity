# Pokemon-Unity

Pokemon Unity was developed by IIcolour Spectrum. He has recently stopped working on the project and has released the source code to the public. The project is incomplete but still holds lots of functionality. Rather then letting the project die, I have created this repo to hopefully let devs keep working on this project, in hope to one day have a complete and functional Pokemon game developed in Unity.

## This Project uses Git LFS
Before cloning this project make sure to have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com./) installed. After Git LFS is installed Github will do all the heavy lifting for the large files. :clap:


## Special Thanks
Special Thanks to IIColour Spectrum for developing this insanely awesome Unity Project.
