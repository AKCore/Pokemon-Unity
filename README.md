# Pokemon-Unity

Pokemon Unity was developed by IIcolour Spectrum. He has recently stopped working on the project and has released the source code to the public. The project is incomplete but still holds lots of functionality. Rather then letting the project die, I have created this repo to hopefully let devs keep working on this project, in hope to one day have a complete and functional Pokemon game developed in Unity.
